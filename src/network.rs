//! [Network], the handle type you use to send messages.
//! 
//! Network is returned from [engine::start](crate::engine::start). It keeps the thread operating the
//! peer alive--the peer stops working when it is dropped.
//! 
//! To send a message using Network, call its [sender](Network::sender) method to get a sender, then
//! call `.send()` on the sender passing in a [SendCommand].
