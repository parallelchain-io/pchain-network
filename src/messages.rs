//! Messages that can be sent using Gossipsub, as well as chainable "gates" to process them on receipt.
//!
//! This module defines four main types:
//! - [Message]: arbitrary data that can be sent over Gossipsub.
//! - [Envelope]: a wrapper over message which contains its origin.
//! - [MessageGateChain]: a chain of [MessageGate]s.
//! - [NetworkTopic]: the pub/sub topic of a message.
//!
//! Message flow starts with a Message received from the network. This message is passed as Envelope into
//! chain of [MessageGate]. Each gate examinates the message's [NetworkTopic] to decide whether it should be
//! proceed. If the gate is not interested in the topic, the message is directly passed to the next gate. Otherwise,
//! the message is proceeded and then the gate can decide whether the message should be passed to next gate, or
//! terminate this message flow.

/// The arbitrary user-defined data that is being transmitted within the network.
pub type Message = Vec<u8>;

/// Envelope encapsulates the message received from the p2p network with the network
/// information such as sender address.
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct Envelope {
    /// The origin of the received message
    pub origin: PublicAddress,

    /// The message encapsulated
    pub message: Message,
}

/// MessageGate is a message handler to proceed the message. It is used
/// with [MessageGateChain] to pass the message to other gate along the chain,
/// as well as stop passing message to the next gate.
///
/// Macro `async_trait` has to be added for using this trait, Example:
///
/// ```no_run
/// struct MyGate {}
///
/// #[async_trait]
/// impl MessageGate for MyGate {
///     async fn can_proceed(&self, topic_hash: &NetworkTopicHash) -> bool {
///         // ... topic filtering
///         true
///     }
///     async fn proceed(&self, envelope: Envelope) -> bool {
///         // ... do something with envelope
///         false // pass the message to next gate
///     }
/// }
/// ```

/// Chain of MessageGate. It consists of a sequence of message handlers.
/// Each message handler (Gate) implements its own message processing logic. Hence,
/// the chain of gates defines a complete flow of message processing.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// To add Gate to the chain:
/// ```no_run
/// let chain = MessageGateChain::new()
///     .chain(message_handler_1)
///     .chain(message_handler_2);
